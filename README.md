# MeDDS-Metal-Surface-Defect-Detection-
1.	The User would be required to put feed in an image of the Metal into the Web Application where the image would be sent to the server for processing. 
2.	Our Trained model which is contained in the Server will accept this image as an input. 
3.	These images will be treated as the input data for the model which will properly pre-processed.
4.	These Scans will be put through our neural network which will be written using Deep Learning libraries like TensorFlow and Keras. 
5.	The Results Generated will be Analyzed and sent back to the Application
6.	These Generated results scan also be accessed by the User from a Database which is present on the Server.
